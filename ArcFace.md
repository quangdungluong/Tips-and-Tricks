- Using Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition.
- The dot product between the DCNN feature and the last fully connected layer is equal to the cosine distance after feature and weight normalisation. We utilise the arc-cosine function to calculate the angle between the current feature and the target weight. Afterwards, we add an additive angular margin to the target angle, and we get the target logit back again by the cosine function. Then, we re-scale all logits by a fixed feature norm, and the subsequent steps are exactly the same as in the softmax loss.
